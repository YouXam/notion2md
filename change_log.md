# Version 1.0.0

- Changed the structure of the exporter to support exporting sub pages and sub files.

- Used Object named '`PageBlockExporter`' to connect supporting functions and attributes.

- Each Exporter has its client(`NotionClient`), page(`notion.Block`), and sub pages' exporter list (`[PageBlockExporter]`)
